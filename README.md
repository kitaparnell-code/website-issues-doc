## Overview
While developing websites on my virtual machine (VM), I encountered several major issues ‚Äî from accidentally overwriting my WordPress installation to downloading the wrong version of Omeka.  
This document records my workflow, mistakes, troubleshooting steps, and final resolutions for reference and learning.

## Issues Summary
- While trying to install Omeka, I overwrote WordPress and lost access.  
- After recovering WordPress, I downloaded the wrong version of Omeka (Omeka S instead of Omeka Classic).

## From My Journal

> **Me:** So... somewhere I messed up. My WordPress page is gone. I get an error page.  
> When I go to my web address: [http://35.193.105.7/](http://35.193.105.7/) I get an index page.  
> I did so much work. I had WordPress installed and ready to be used and now it's gone.  
> All I have are zip files and error pages.

## Original Workflow

I was in my shell, moving Omeka zip files to the web root and unzipping Omeka:

```bash
sudo unzip omeka.zip
Mistake 1 ‚Äì Downloaded the Wrong Version
I downloaded Omeka S instead of Omeka Classic.

I then moved the contents of the Omeka folder to /var/www/html:

bash
Copy code
sudo mv omeka/* /var/www/html/
sudo rm -rf omeka
Mistake 2 ‚Äì Incorrect Permissions Advice
After searching online, I found the following advice and used it to set permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
I thought everything was fine, so I continued to create a MySQL database for Omeka:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE omeka DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
CREATE USER 'omekauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'omekapassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omeka.* TO 'omekauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Problems Encountered
Tried opening Omeka in Chrome and got nothing.

In my VM, omeka.zip wasn‚Äôt found, but I located omeka-s.zip instead.

When I tried sudo unzip omeka.zip, I received errors because the file didn‚Äôt exist.

I removed the zip to start over:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm omeka.zip
When I checked my files:

bash
Copy code
ls -l
It showed:

css
Copy code
-rw-r--r-- 1 root www-data 0 Oct 7 11:39 omeka.zip
My zip file had 0 data, confirming it wasn‚Äôt downloaded correctly.

Mistake 3 ‚Äì Cleared the Web Root
I followed Google‚Äôs suggestion to start fresh and cleared my web root:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
Then, I downloaded Omeka S again by mistake.
At this point, I realized that both my Omeka and WordPress installations were missing.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs WordPress? Also, still no data in omeka.zip.‚Äù

I needed to figure out what happened to both my OPAC and WordPress.

Troubleshooting WordPress
Step 1 ‚Äì Reinstall WordPress
Checked all requirements ‚úÖ

Verified PHP modules using apt ‚Äî already installed ‚úÖ

Restarted Apache2 and MySQL ‚Äî all good ‚úÖ

Downloaded the latest version of WordPress:

bash
Copy code
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
The download completed successfully.

Step 2 ‚Äì Unzip and Setup Database
Unzipped the file (lots of inflating and extracting).

Created the database and user:

sql
Copy code
CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXXX';
Received an error:

sql
Copy code
ERROR 1356 create user failed
After reviewing, I realized the database and user already existed from my earlier setup.

Step 3 ‚Äì Configure wp-config.php
Exited MySQL and opened the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano wp-config.php
Added the correct database name, username, and password.
Reopened my site at http://35.193.105.7 ‚Äî success!

When visiting http://35.193.105.7/wordpress/, it redirected properly.

Then, I moved WordPress from /wordpress to /library:

bash
Copy code
sudo mv /var/www/html/wordpress /var/www/html/library
However, that caused a broken link until I corrected the references.

Checked for Errors
Attempted to fix ownership again:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/library
Still received the same error page.

Then I tried visiting:

ruby
Copy code
http://35.193.105.7/library/wp-admin/install.php
That worked ‚Äî but my database name didn‚Äôt match!
In nano, the DB name was different from my MySQL database list.

Fix
I corrected inconsistencies:

Changed library back to wordpress

Changed all instances of ‚ÄòKita‚Äô to lowercase ‚Äòkita‚Äô

After saving and restarting Apache, the site worked! üéâ

Reinstallation of Omeka
After recovering WordPress, I moved on to reinstall Omeka properly.

Step 1 ‚Äì Update and Confirm Dependencies
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install imagemagick -y
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Everything was already installed and up-to-date.

Step 2 ‚Äì Create a New Database for Omeka
Logged into MySQL:

bash
Copy code
sudo mysql -u root -p
Created the database and user:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE omekadb;
CREATE USER 'omekauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'R3b0ct78#N2p';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omekadb.* TO 'omekauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Step 3 ‚Äì Download and Unzip Omeka Classic (the Correct Version)
Changed to the web root directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /var/www/html
Downloaded the correct version of Omeka Classic:

bash
Copy code
sudo wget https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1.2/omeka-3.1.2.zip
sudo unzip omeka-3.1.2.zip
sudo mv omeka-3.1.2 omeka
Success! ‚úÖ

Step 4 ‚Äì Configure Database File
Opened the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
cd /var/www/html/omeka
sudo nano db.ini
Added the following details:

ini
Copy code
user     = "omekauser"
password = "R3b0ct78#N2p"
host     = "localhost"
dbname   = "omekadb"
prefix   = "omeka_"
charset  = "utf8"
Step 5 ‚Äì Set Ownership and Permissions
bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/omeka
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/omeka
Restarted Apache and opened in the browser:

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/install/

Entered credentials and installed successfully! üéâ

Visited:

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/collections/browse

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/admin

Omeka was working perfectly.

Issues Resolved
While installing Omeka, I overwrote WordPress and lost access. ‚úÖ Fixed by restoring WordPress configuration and database names.

WordPress was in an unreachable subdirectory. ‚úÖ Fixed by adjusting directory structure.

Downloaded the wrong version of Omeka (Omeka S). ‚úÖ Deleted and replaced with Omeka Classic.

Successfully installed and configured both WordPress and Omeka Classic on my VM. üéØ

Reflection
This experience reinforced how important version control, directory management, and careful file handling are when working in a VM environment. I learned to verify file versions, maintain consistent database names, and always back up configurations before making changes.
