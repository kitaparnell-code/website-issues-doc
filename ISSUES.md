## Issues Encountered

While trying to install **Omeka**, I accidentally overwrote **WordPress** and lost access to my site.  
After recovering WordPress, I realized I had downloaded the wrong version of Omeka.

## My Original Workflow

I started by moving the Omeka zip files to the web root and unzipping:

```bash
sudo unzip omeka.zip
Mistake 1 ‚Äì Downloaded Omeka S Instead of Omeka Classic
Then I moved the contents to the web root:

bash
Copy code
sudo mv omeka/* /var/www/html/
sudo rm -rf omeka
Mistake 2 ‚Äì Permissions Adjustments Gone Wrong
I followed advice from Google to set permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
Everything seemed fine, so I went on to create a MySQL database for Omeka:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE omeka DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
CREATE USER 'omekauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'omekapassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omeka.* TO 'omekauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
After restarting Apache, I tried opening Omeka in Chrome ‚Äî nothing.
The omeka.zip file wasn‚Äôt found. I located omeka-s.zip and tried unzipping it again, but errors appeared.
That‚Äôs when I realized I had the wrong version of Omeka.

Then I ran:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm omeka.zip
ls -l
Output:

css
Copy code
-rw-r--r-- 1 root www-data 0 Oct 7 11:39 omeka.zip
My zip file had 0 bytes ‚Äî it was empty.

Mistake 3 ‚Äì Clearing My Web Root
I followed another online suggestion to start fresh:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
This deleted everything, including WordPress.
Downloaded Omeka S again. Still no luck.
At this point, I had no working WordPress or Omeka.

Troubleshooting WordPress
I decided to reinstall WordPress.

Checked requirements ‚Äî all good. Installed additional PHP modules (already present). Restarted Apache and MySQL successfully.

Downloaded WordPress:

bash
Copy code
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
sudo unzip latest.zip
Created a database and user:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXX';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpress'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
I edited the wp-config.php file with my database details:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano wp-config.php
When I opened my site at http://35.193.105.7, I got the setup page ‚Äî success!

Then I moved the directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo mv /var/www/html/wordpress /var/www/html/library
But I still got an error. I realized my database name and username weren‚Äôt consistent ‚Äî some were capitalized differently (‚ÄúKita‚Äù vs ‚Äúkita‚Äù). After correcting these in Nano, the site finally loaded again. üéâ

Reinstalling Omeka (Correctly This Time)
Time for a fresh start with Omeka Classic.

Updated Apache and verified dependencies:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install imagemagick -y
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Created a new database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE omekadb;
CREATE USER 'omekauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'R3b0ct78#N2p';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omekadb.* TO 'omekauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Downloaded the correct Omeka version:

bash
Copy code
cd /var/www/html
sudo wget https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1.2/omeka-3.1.2.zip
sudo unzip omeka-3.1.2.zip
sudo mv omeka-3.1.2 omeka
Configured Omeka‚Äôs database file:

bash
Copy code
cd /var/www/html/omeka
sudo nano db.ini
Inside:

ini
Copy code
user     = "omekauser"
password = "R3b0ct78#N2p"
host     = "localhost"
dbname   = "omekadb"
prefix   = "omeka_"
charset  = "utf8"
Set ownership and permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/omeka
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/omeka
Then opened in browser:

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/

http://35.193.105.7/omeka/install/

It worked! Installation complete.

After logging into the admin side, I changed the site theme and created a test collection.

Issues Resolved
Accidentally overwrote WordPress ‚Äî recovered by reinstalling and fixing directory names
Wrong Omeka version (Omeka S) ‚Äî replaced with Omeka Classic
Empty zip file ‚Äî confirmed proper download via wget
Database inconsistencies ‚Äî corrected capitalization and database references
Permissions ‚Äî verified correct ownership for Apache

Lessons Learned
Always confirm which version of software you‚Äôre downloading (Omeka Classic ‚â† Omeka S).

Avoid clearing /var/www/html without backups.

Keep naming consistent ‚Äî even capitalization matters.

Test in small steps before major deletions or overwrites.

Documentation saves you ‚Äî this journal made it possible to retrace every fix.

‚ÄúI breathed!‚Äù ‚Äî the exact moment when everything finally worked again.
